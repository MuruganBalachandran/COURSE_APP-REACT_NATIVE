# **Course App**

![CourseApp](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c514f2e-fec3-473a-ade0-89d13a35e3c1)

## Getting Started

> **Note**: Before proceeding, ensure you've completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions up to the "Creating a new application" step.

### Prerequisites

This project builds upon the concepts covered in the **React Native and Firebase** course app, which I have completed. If you're familiar with React Native and Firebase integration, you'll find this setup straightforward.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

Metro is the JavaScript bundler that ships with React Native. To start Metro, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Keep the Metro Bundler running in its own terminal. In a new terminal, navigate to the root of your React Native project and run the following command to start your Android or iOS app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If your environment is set up correctly, your new app should start running in the Android Emulator or iOS Simulator.

### Note

In addition to running the app from the terminal, you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that your app is running, let's make some modifications.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> on Windows and Linux, or <kbd>Cmd âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> on macOS) to see your changes.

   For **iOS**: Press <kbd>Cmd âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and view your changes.

## Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰

You've successfully run and modified your React Native app. ðŸŽŠ
